# BetterThanLinkedIn
Graphs: Better than LinkedIn
Basically the concept is that I want to create some website that is better than linkedIn and want it to be opens-sourced. LinkedIn is often full of crap and nonsense and I cannot tolerate the 'feed' system; it is similar to YouTube and I dislike it a lot. Instead of that, let us make a website called 'Graphs'. The name comes from the thought that every connection you made is like a node in the graph. As you traverse the graph you find more acquantainces. 
I will prefer a javascript framework of the project. You can use full stack - the famous technologies in order to make a technical website. Remember that all nonsensical features of linkedIn especially the 'influencers' must be crapped out. 
It is all about recruiters, workforce, startups, and growth.
